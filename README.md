# Morpho
Unsupervised morphological analysis. I built this software with the help of Domonique R.M. for LING 449 (Language and Computationa), Fall 2015.

The script takes two parameters: the corpus and the number of words to sample, e.g. ```morpho.py wordsEn.txt 10000```. Accuracy increases with the number of words, but also the running time.
